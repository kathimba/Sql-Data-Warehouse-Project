# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics.

---
## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
